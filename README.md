# Handling_Cloud_Optimized_Geotiffs
Here I have described how a cog can be accessed and processed,  starting from very basic and single cogs to reading it and processing it. Finally I have used the Sentinel 1 and 2 cog urls and downloaded only those tiff files which is useful for me.
Also the code for QGIS python console is given to read the COGs directly to import it to layer panel.
In "Reading COGs in QGIS" file both ways the aoi can be found, either by importing an active layer or by panning the aoi to map view in QGIS.
Further processing and analysis can be done to these cogs without downloading all the uneccessary files to memory.
